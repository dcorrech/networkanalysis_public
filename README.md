# networkanalysis_public
Scripts for social network influence analysis directed studies project, supervised by Dr. Laks V.S. Lakshmanan, implementing algorithms from Goyal et al (2011).

This repo includes code from my COGS402 network analysis project, without any of the data used or sensitive information, posted after all changes were made in the private repo.

* influence_spread.py implements data-based infuence spread algorithm from Goyal et al (2011).
* dogwood.py, leap.py, and poli_final.py construct the social network structures for each dataset.
* tweet-scrape.py, format_tweets.py and combine_tweets.py handles the Twitter data for members of the Canadian House of Parliament.
